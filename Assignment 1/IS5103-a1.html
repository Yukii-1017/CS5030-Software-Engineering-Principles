                    Old people have different needs, for example, some aim to be safe and health (Murphy A., 2019); others need to
                     connect with other family members and friends. These needs facing with technologies challenges in modern 
                     technology age. 
                     <br/><br/>
                    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Health care
                    Health deterioration is increasing with aging, so they could hardly live without healthcare. While more and 
                    more aging people in the world, but less and less healthcare people (bismart, 2019). This is one of the 
                    difficulties we met. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    In terms of better health care, wearable devices could help to give alert and provide health care services, 
                    such as a kidney dialysis and a VR headset (Ramanathan N.,2019). IOT could help with the elder live in their 
                    own home and using virtual healthcare and assistance could provide an easier way for them to hospitalize. In 
                    addition, AI could help to predict illness (bismart, 2019).

                    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Communication and Technology gap
                    Some old people give up using smart phones or other technologies, so they cannot scan QR code (Murphy A., 2019) 
                    or entertain with the young. In this situation, some of them might face with loneliness (bismart, 2019). 
                    <br/><br/>
                    To address this issue, developers could provide elder-accessible apps and devices , such as hardware with large
                     - button keyboard (Murphy A., 2019); customizer software for senior citizens.
