                                Some people have visual impairment, which is often defined as legal blindness as a
                                condition where the best corrected visual acuity is equal to or less than 20/200, or
                                where the person's field of vision is equal to or less than 20 degrees. A visual acuity
                                of 20/200 means that the person would have to stand 20 feet away to see what a person
                                with 20/20 vision could see from a distance of 200 feet. Blind people can use a variety
                                of assistive technologies to support common tasks, such as using the Internet (WebAIM,
                                2020).

                            <p>
                                Another category of visual disability is low vision - usually considered to be
                                uncorrectable to near 20/20 vision. It is common among the elderly, but young people can
                                suffer from this disability, whether due to genetics, trauma or disease.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The third category of visual impairment is colour blindness or colour-blindness,
                                although it may be an overstatement to call colour-blindness a true impairment, since it
                                is a condition with few real limitations. Nonetheless, it is helpful to be aware of
                                colour-blindness when designing Web content.

                                    People with low vision have highly variable vision, but low vision is usually
                                    defined as a condition in which a person's vision is not fully corrected by glasses
                                    and interferes with daily activities such as reading and driving. Amblyopia is more
                                    common in the elderly, but low vision can occur at any age due to conditions such as
                                    macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, or cataracts.

                                                <p><strong>Screen Magnifiers and Zoom:</strong></p>
                                                <p>Screen magnification or zooming is the most common technique used by people
                                                    with low vision. Software or operating system settings can be used to
                                                    magnify the entire screen or parts of the screen so that people with low
                                                    vision can see it more clearly. Users can also use browser settings to zoom
                                                    in on a web page or increase its default text size. However, certain content
                                                    can be difficult to interpret when zoomed in or out. For example, graphics
                                                    containing text may become blocky and pixelated when zoomed in, making the
                                                    text difficult to read. Consider the two images below(WebAIM, 2020).

                                                    <strong>Tips:</strong><br>
                                                    To make text more legible when zoomed in, please use real text wherever
                                                    possible rather than text in graphics. Pages should be designed so that no
                                                    content or functionality is lost when zooming/zooming or increasing text
                                                    size. Where possible, avoid horizontal scrolling - it is particularly
                                                    difficult to read page content when users must scroll or pan to read lines
                                                    of text that extend beyond the screen. Implementing responsive/adaptive
                                                    design to support small screens and mobile devices will also better ensure
                                                    that content adapts to the screen as it is zoomed or enlarged.

                                                    text or graphics and their backgrounds) can be difficult to read, especially
                                                    for people with low vision. Some colour combinations are not easy for

                                                    certain users with poor vision may require greater contrast. Some may

                                    Color blindness or lack of color vision is the inability to distinguish between
                                    certain shades of color. This is an interesting topic due to its complexity. There
                                    are three types of photoreceptors in the eye. Each is responsible for detecting
                                    different wavelengths of color. In addition, there are photoreceptors that detect
                                    the intensity of light, called rods. If these types of photoreceptors are missing or
                                    they are not functioning correctly, color blindness may occur. The most common type
                                    of color blindness is a lack of red and green - this does not mean that you cannot
                                    see red and/or green, but certain shades of red and green may be difficult to
                                    distinguish.

                                    There is no need to get rid of colour when designing web content. It is not
                                    necessary to convert all images to black and white or get rid of images altogether.
                                    In fact, it may not be necessary to make any changes at all. Most of the time,
                                    colour is irrelevant to understanding what’s on the Web. However, when colours are
                                    used to convey or differentiate information (such as pie charts or bar charts, or
                                    the use of green and red text to indicate pass/fail or good/bad, etc.), this
                                    information should be provided in other ways as well (WebAIM, 2020).

                                    It is difficult to distinguish routes after removing color information,

                                    While the use of colour can enhance the user experience, when colours may not be
                                    perceived (including by blind users), are overridden by custom settings, or cannot
                                    be easily distinguished, a different style is needed to convey this information
                                    through annotated images. Each line, or on a web page, supplement the image with
                                    text that conveys the same information (WebAIM, 2020).

                                    Blind people are able to listen to Web content. A number of software programs called screen readers have been developed that convert text and other information from Web pages into synthesized speech. Such as Screen readers that 'Software that reads text on the screen with a synthetic voice and Refreshable braille displays that A device that dynamically displays lines of text on the screen in braille (Brewer, 1999). In addition to simply reading the screen, screen readers allow users to view Web content in a variety of ways.

                                    Deaf and blind people can also use refreshable Braille devices to convert screen readers to Braille instead of speech. The small pins of such devices can be raised or lowered to create Braille characters that can be perceived by deaf-blind people. Although screen readers cannot always completely replace the visual experience, when accessibility is considered, they can provide screen reader users with a high degree of access to most Web content. Screen readers cannot analyse images to extract meaning. In order to understand what an image's <strong><a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/" target="blank">alternative text</a> </strong> conveys, it must be provided with content. Similarly, a sighted user could scan a web page and quickly determine how the page is organized and make visual correlations or distinctions between content based on layout, proximity, or visual design. Screen readers cannot perform this operation. However, pages that are properly structured and contain appropriate code associations can greatly enhance the ability of screen reader users to have the same experience (©WebAIM, 2020).
